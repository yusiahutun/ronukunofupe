What was more interesting to Bolton, he says, was to focus on the work, and that was daunting enough. He examined 10,000 items before slowly winnowing the show down to about 200.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'He was Karl,' the curator said, noting that Lagerfeld himself referred to not always meaning what he said. 'There could be 10, 20 different shows on Karl. To me, I thought the way to get to know him better, and understand his contradictions, was through his work.' And at end of the day, he says, 'that´s his legacy - the body of work you see here.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Bolton´s shows, which have brought many thousands of visitors to the museum, have mostly centered on concepts and not individuals.

Bolton was at Lagerfeld's memorial at the majestic Grand Palais in Paris - 'much hoopla, as you can imagine' - and was touched by footage of the designer sketching, 'lost in his imagination, oblivious to everybody.' He started dreaming up a show. (Lagerfeld was also a close friend of Anna Wintour, the influential Vogue editor who masterminds the gala and is one of this year´s hosts. Chanel is the show´s main sponsor.)</p><img id=i-2b7cabaa71645aaf src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/05/01/17/70435197-12034011-Designs_by_Karl_Lagerfeld_are_displayed_at_the_Metropolitan_Muse-a-61_1682960139158.jpg height=390 width=586 alt="A guitar was on the back of one dress while another included a candelabra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class="imageCaption mol-para-with-font">A guitar was on the back of one dress while another included a candelabra&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The exhibit centers first and foremost on the dichotomy of the curved 'S' line (think romantic, decorative) and the straight line (modern, minimalist), with one curved wall and one straight wall in each gallery, and designs that express each aesthetic.
