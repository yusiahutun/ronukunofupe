It is very immediate and extremely powerful.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When the collection appeared, he told British fashion magazine Tank, “When you are in China, it’s the most colourful, urban landscape you’ve ever seen. Lights, LED screens everywhere and everybody’s also dressed extremely colourfully. It was very important to mimic the feeling I have when I take the plane from London and land in Shanghai – it’s really like an LSD experience, a feast for the eyes.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Fashion is tired’: how it can change, starting with fashion weeks</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This idea of colour is part of the brand’s DNA, he says, and it will remain in the collections ahead.

Rather, 27 looks were offered in online images taken in the design studio during fittings, where a single model was photographed in front of a virtually shadowless white screen.</p>Shang Xia never planned to join the treadmill of seasonal runway shows anyway. It was rethinking the fundamentals of the business. One of the decisions was to <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">launch the collection virtually</span></a>.

It, too, was expanding from China via Paris, but taking a very different path.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Luxury fashion needs to evolve.

They couldn’t find the kind of professional clothes that suited them as recent graduates, so they designed items for themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/29/e6651404-6346-4044-b359-8b9c921f613a_bcabd21d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was a time of urbanisation and a growing middle class gaining purchasing power, says Isabelle Capron, Icicle’s top executive in Paris. During this wave of movement to the cities, they saw a new class of urban professionals with new fashion needs. They wanted to make clothes, but without damaging nature.</p>“This was their vision,” she explains. “You can say that they’re an <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">eco-brand</span></a>, because in the DNA is this idea of making fashion while respecting nature, making beautiful fashion that can be attractive, especially by using natural materials, either undyed or dyed with natural pigments.”<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Passionate about fabrics, Icicle worked with silk, cotton and cashmere, but also less glamorous materials such as hemp, one of the most sustainable fibres: it requires little water, is renewable and has a less harmful environmental impact than nearly any other alternative.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/29/d3d760e6-fcbc-4836-861a-7db40f8114a9_3372269c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The concept is “natural and durable fashion”, says Capron. “Natural meaning we take from nature, and respect nature in everything we do. And,” she stresses, “durable” – the opposite of fast fashion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The style is timeless. It is beyond seasons. We are not slaves to seasons. You can wear the clothes for 10 years, for 15 years. And then naturally one day, those clothes will go back to nature. It’s a kind of circular fashion, a slow fashion. Twenty-five years ago, no one was thinking about this.”</p>With 271 stores and counting in 100 cities in China, Icicle has become one of the country’s best known clothing brands. In 2020, it generated €334 million in retail turnover, and, despite the pandemic, grew by more than 12 per cent from 2019. In 2020, it topped <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tmall’s famous Double 11 Singles’ Day sales</span></a> for luxury womenswear.

In 2013, Icicle set up a design studio in Paris’s 16th arrondissement, on Avenue Raymond-Poincaré, a stately thoroughfare that runs between Place Victor Hugo and the Trocadéro, across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Icicle chose Paris over London, Milan and New York and recruited from French luxury labels, hiring the highly experienced Capron as its international vice-president and general manager of its Paris Design Centre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Capron had been executive vice-president at Fauchon during a period of global expansion when the company became a leader in French luxury food and launched in more than 40 countries. Before that, she had worked in advertising with a focus on luxury brands in fashion and retail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/29/1dfd4ff7-5d82-4949-8207-24acc8a48ad5_3d8ed0bf.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another important Paris hire was Bénédicte Laloux, a designer who has worked for Celine, Lanvin and Chloé. Laloux spent a year in China to better understand the Chinese fashion world, and has risen through the ranks to become Icicle’s creative director.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The brand’s logo reads “Made in Earth”, which has a dual meaning. “Made in Earth means made with elements of the earth,” says Capron. “But it also means, made with the talent of Earth, the talent of the world, because we have an international team. Of course, we have the Chinese team in Shanghai, but we also have lots of international talent here [in Paris].”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Icicle has some 2,700 employees, including around 60 in Paris. For Capron, the synergy between the two bases is key. In 2019, Icicle opened its first international boutique in a historic 1894 town house on the prestigious Avenue George V.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/29/4a0ecd6b-f99d-402d-8131-ace6b9c8ef2e_316c7935.jpg>Located just off the <a class="e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-1ankfgb ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Champs-Élysées</span></a> and near Louis Vuitton’s art deco flagship store, it is a just a door down from the Four Seasons Hotel George V, one of the world’s great (and most expensive) hotels, and diagonally opposite the new, ultra-luxurious Bvlgari Hotel.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dubois, who also designed this recent store, sought an aesthetic that captured the company’s philosophy of finding harmony between man and nature. The 440 square metres (4,740 square feet) of space spread out over four floors is spacious and well lit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The floors are made with pale Paloma limestone, while dust from the same stone is used in the plaster for the walls and ceilings, creating a sense of continuity.

Founded in 1945 by Marie-Louise Carven, the company had gone into receivership, and the €4.2 million acquisition kept it from liquidation. Icicle relaunched the brand, first in China and then in France. There are now seven Carven stores in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is really the combination of two brands, two cultures, two markets,” says Capron in the fourth floor of the George V flagship. They “are very complementary geographically, because Icicle is developed in China with international potential, and Carven is known in the West with China potential”. Compared with Icicle’s more minimal style, Carven’s is lively and colourful, with plenty of paisleys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/04/29/7da1daff-4021-4240-a794-d5bfa43ef01f_cf485805.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last year, Icicle created the ICCF Group (Icicle Carven China France). The group’s logo intertwines the initials of the two brands. Set in a square, the letters evoke two keys. “By working together, with different cultures, different ways of thinking,” says Capron, “we can do something new.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While it took six years to realise the first Icicle store in Paris, other outposts have come in accelerated fashion, and in increasingly upscale and prominent locations. Last October, Icicle opened a boutique in the Haussmann branch of Galeries Lafayette.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Located on the first floor among other luxury designers, the narrow space sits beside Valentino and faces Balmain. In January, Icicle added another in Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche. Both are highly visible retail outlets in two of Europe’s most celebrated department stores. And then, a month later, the doors opened to its newest shop, on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">What can the West learn from China’s luxury e-commerce revolution?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In all four Paris locations, its new leather shoulder “seed bags” are prominently displayed.

It also makes the product relatively good value. While Icicle sells cashmere beanies for €290 and bucket hats for €250, the three sizes of leather shoulder seed bags are priced at €250 (mini), €450 (small) and €590 (medium).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Today, sustainability is one of the most important buzzwords in the fashion industry, with virtually every major brand putting out sustainable collections.

Or, as it now seems, ‘Marketing our Sustainability Initiatives Day’.”)</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Icicle “was born as an eco-brand”, says Capron. “Very few brands can say that.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China matters to luxury brands – CEOs tell us why</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Examples such as this recall how the “Made in China” issue isn’t necessarily about quality but rather about perception, marketing and branding. Shang Xia and Icicle are two companies changing what Made in China means, but as high-end fashion brands relatively new to the international scene, they face a unique hurdle.</p>Most luxury sales are to first-time buyers, and first-time buyers usually buy legacy brands.

It requires a lot of time.
